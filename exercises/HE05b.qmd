# 1. Overview

Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic used to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.

When multivariate data is used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.

There are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix:

1.  To reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.

2.  To input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.

3.  As a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.

When the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, [Corrgram](http://www.datavis.ca/papers/corrgram.pdf) tends to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:

-   Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and

-   Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, we will learn how to create correlation matrix using [*pairs()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.0/topics/pairs) of R Graphics. Next, we will learn how to plot corrgram using **corrplot** package of R. And lastly, we will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R.

# 2. Getting Started

::: panel-tabset
## Installing and loading packages

For this exercise, we will use the code chunk below to install and launch **corrplot**, **ggpubr**, **plotly** and **tidyverse** in RStudio.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(corrplot, ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

## Importing Data

In this hands-on exercise, the [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.

Let's import the data into R using by using *read_csv()* of **readr** package.

```{r}
wine <- read_csv("../data/wine_quality.csv") 
```

Notice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.

## Understanding the data

```{r}
glimpse(wine)
```

# 3. Building Correlation Matrix: *pairs()* method

There are more ways than one to build a scatterplot matrix with R. In this section, we will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the *pairs* function of R Graphics.

Before you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of [*pairs*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/pairs.html) function.

## 3.1 Building a basic correlation matrix

::: panel-tabset
### Correlation plot with columns 1-11

Figure below shows the scatter plot matrix for Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
pairs(wine[,1:11])
```

### Correlation plot with columns 2-12

The required input of *pairs()* can be a matrix or a data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default *pairs* function. Columns 2 to 12 of the wine dataframe are used to build the scatterplot matrix.

The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
pairs(wine[,2:12])
```
:::

## 3.2 Drawing the lower corner

The *pairs* function of R Graphics provides many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both, since a correlation matrix is symmetric.

::: panel-tabset
### Lower half of correlation plot

Let's first show the lower half of the correlation matrix by using the upper.panel argument as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
pairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)
```

### Upper half of correlation plot

Similarly, we can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
pairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)
```
:::

## 3.3 Including with Correlation Coefficients

To show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, [*panel.cor*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/xcms/versions/1.48.0/topics/panel.cor) function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
panel.cor <- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix="", cex.cor, ...) {
usr <- par("usr")
on.exit(par(usr))
par(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
r <- abs(cor(x, y, use="complete.obs"))
txt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]
txt <- paste(prefix, txt, sep="")
if(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor <- 0.8/strwidth(txt)
text(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)
}

pairs(wine[,2:12], 
      upper.panel = panel.cor)
```

# 4. Visualising Correlation Matrix: **ggcormat()**

One of the major limitations of the correlation matrix is that the scatter plots appear very cluttered when the number of observations are relatively large (i.e. more than 500 observations). To overcome this problem, we will use the **Corrgram** data visualisation technique suggested by D. J. Murdoch and E. D. Chow (1996) and Friendly, M (2002).

There are at least three R packages provided functions to plot corrgram:

-   [corrgram](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrgram/index.html)

-   [ellipse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ellipse/index.html)

-   [corrplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/index.html)

In addition to these, some R packages like ggstatsplot also provide functions for building corrgram.

In this section, we will learn how to visualise the correlation matrix by using [*ggcorrmat()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggcorrmat.html) of [**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) package.

## 4.1 The basic plot

One of the advantages of using *ggcorrmat()* to visualise a correlation matrix over (many) other methods is its ability to provide a comprehensive yet professional statistical report as shown in the figure below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
ggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(
  data = wine, 
  cor.vars = 1:11)
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
ggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(
  data = wine, 
  cor.vars = 1:11,
  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = "black", 
                         hc.order = TRUE,
                         tl.cex = 10),
  title    = "Correlogram for wine dataset",
  subtitle = "Four pairs are no significant at p < 0.05"
)
```

::: callout-note
Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   `cor.vars` argument is used to compute the correlation matrix needed to build the corrgram.

-   `ggcorrplot.args` argument provide additional (mostly aesthetic) arguments that will be passed to [`ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot`](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggcorrplot-visualization-of-a-correlation-matrix-using-ggplot2) function. The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: `corr`, `method`, `p.mat`, `sig.level`, `ggtheme`, `colors`, `lab`, `pch`, `legend.title`, `digits`.
:::

The sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific components of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
ggplot.component = list(
    theme(text=element_text(size=5),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))
```

# 5. Building Multiple Plots

Since ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in *ggcorrmat()* but in the [*grouped_ggcorrmat()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/grouped_ggcorrmat.html) of **ggstatsplot**.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
grouped_ggcorrmat(
  data = wine,
  cor.vars = 1:11,
  grouping.var = type,
  type = "robust",
  p.adjust.method = "holm",
  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),
  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = "black", 
                         hc.order = TRUE,
                         tl.cex = 10),
  annotation.args = list(
    tag_levels = "a",
    title = "Correlogram for wine dataset",
    subtitle = "The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity",
    caption = "Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository"
  )
)
```

::: callout-note
Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   to build a facet plot, the only argument needed is `grouping.var`.

-   Behind *group_ggcorrmat()*, **patchwork** package is used to create the multiplot. `plotgrid.args` argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to [*patchwork::wrap_plots*](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html), except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.

-   Likewise, `annotation.args` argument is calling [*plot annotation arguments*](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/plot_annotation.html) of patchwork package.

# 6. Visualising Correlation Matrix Using corrplot Package

In this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. Before getting started, make sure to read [An Introduction to corrplot Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) in order to gain a basic understanding of **corrplot** package.

## 6.1 Getting started with corrplot

Before we can plot a corrgram using *corrplot()*, we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.

In the code chunk below, [*cor()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.0/topics/cor) of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.

```{r}
wine.cor <- cor(wine[, 1:11])
```

Next, [*corrplot()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/corrplot/versions/0.2-0/topics/corrplot) is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default settings as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor)
```

Notice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is a circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also known as **saturation** is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicate relatively weaker linear relationship.

## 6.2 Working with visual geometrics

In **corrplot** package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the *method* argument as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor, 
         method = "ellipse") 
```

Feel free to experiment with other supported visual geometrics by changing the *method* argument.

## 6.3 Working with layout

*corrplor()* supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”.

The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the *type* argument of *corrplot()*.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor, 
         method = "ellipse", 
         type="lower")
```

The default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments *diag* and *tl.col* are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor, 
         method = "ellipse", 
         type="lower",
         diag = FALSE,
         tl.col = "black")
```

Feel free to experiment with other layout design arguments such as *tl.pos*, *tl.cex*, *tl.offset*, *cl.pos*, *cl.cex* and *cl.offset*, just to mention a few of them.

## 6.4 Working with mixed layout

With **corrplot** package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the [*corrplot.mixed()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/corrplot/versions/0.84/topics/corrplot.mixed), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.

Code chunk and figure below show a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot.mixed(wine.cor, 
               lower = "ellipse", 
               upper = "number",
               tl.pos = "lt",
               diag = "l",
               tl.col = "black")
```

Notice that the arguments *lower* and *upper* are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument *tl.pos*, on the other hand, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the *diag* argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.

## 6.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test

In statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables have correlation coefficients that are statistically significant.

With corrplot package, we can use the *cor.mtest()* to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.

```{r}
wine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)
```

We can then use the *p.mat* argument of *corrplot* function as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor,
         method = "number",
         type = "lower",
         diag = FALSE,
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         p.mat = wine.sig$p,
         sig.level = .05)
```

## 6.6 Reorder a corrgram

Matrix reorder is very important for mining the hidden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-written by using the *order* argument of *corrplot()*. Currently, the **corrplot** package supports four sorting methods, they are:

-   “AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.

-   “FPC” for the first principal component order.

-   “hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.

    -   “hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.

-   “alphabet” for alphabetical order.

“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in the **seriation** package.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot.mixed(wine.cor, 
               lower = "ellipse", 
               upper = "number",
               tl.pos = "lt",
               diag = "l",
               order="AOE",
               tl.col = "black")
```

## 6.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust

If using **hclust**, ***corrplot()*** can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 13
#| fig-align: center
corrplot(wine.cor, 
         method = "ellipse", 
         tl.pos = "lt",
         tl.col = "black",
         order="hclust",
         hclust.method = "ward.D",
         addrect = 3)
```
