Overview\n\n## 1.1 Background\n\nStudent learning outcomes are widely recognized as a key indicator of educational quality and institutional effectiveness. Understanding what influences student performance can help institutions improve teaching approaches, strengthen support systems, and create learning environments that encourage success. As higher education continues to evolve alongside technological and social changes, examining these factors has become increasingly relevant for educators and researchers alike.\n\nThis study focuses on students from the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, and explores the factors that may shape their academic outcomes. By looking at aspects such as lecturers’ quality, university support, curriculum structure, facilities, classroom competition, and peer influence, the dataset offers useful insights into the conditions that contribute to student achievement and overall learning experiences.\n\n## 1.2 The data\n\nThe dataset for this exercise was retreived from [Mendeley Data - Dataset about VNU students](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1). It is provided in **.xlsx format** and is accompanied by a codebook that outlines the question types and survey response options in English.\n\nThe dataset was collected through a structured survey administered between March and June 2023 to students and alumni of the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi. A total of 2,170 respondents participated, providing information on multiple dimensions that may affect learning outcomes.\n\n## 1.3 The task\n\nUsing this dataset, the objective is to apply appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and data visualization methods to uncover meaningful insights into the factors affecting student learning outcomes. The analysis will focus on identifying patterns, distributions, and relationships among key variables, as well as examining how different academic and institutional factors contribute to student success.\n\n# 2. Getting Started\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Installing and loading packages\n\nFor this exercise, the below R packages will be used:\n\n-   tidyverse - a collection of R packages used for data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and visualisation\n\n-   readxl - used to import the Excel worksheet\n\n-   patchwork - used for creating composite figures using ggplot2\n\n-   ggstatsplot - used for statistical inference methods\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish this task.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, readxl, patchwork, ggstatsplot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing the data\n\nThe code chunk below imports the dataset using `read_xlsx()` of the readxl package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- read_xlsx(\"../data/Database_paper.xlsx\", sheet=1) \n```\n:::\n\n\nUpon importing, we need to first check whether the imported data is accurate and complete. To do that, we can go to the Environment tab in RStudio -\\> click on vnu under Data, where we can see that there are 2170 rows and 22 columns, which is the same as the original excel file.\n\nAdditionally, the `glimpse()` function of dplyr package (part of tidyverse) can also be used to check the above. It also gives us the data types of the variables, which in this case are all dbl data type (double-precision floating-point numbers).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(vnu)\n```\n\n:::

Data Wrangling\n\n## 3.2 Checking for missing values\n\nBefore making any changes to the variables, it is important to first check for missing values to prevent issues during recoding. If missing values are not identified beforehand, there is a risk of unintentionally assigning values to observations that were originally recorded as NA.\n\n`is.na()` allows us to identify missing values in our dataset and `sum()` counts the frequency of such missing values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(is.na(vnu))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are no missing values in the dataset.\n\n## 3.3 Recoding to Categorical Variables\n\nThe `mutate()` function from the **dplyr** package is used alongside `recode()` and `factor()` to convert the variables as per below. The `recode()` function is used to assign descriptive labels to nominal variables that have no natural order, while `factor()` is used for ordinal variables to convert them into categories and ensure they are displayed in the correct logical order during analysis and visualisation.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Year\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = factor(Year,\n                  levels = 1:5,\n                  labels = c(\"First-year\",\n                             \"Second-year\",\n                             \"Third-year\",\n                             \"Fourth-year\",\n                             \"Graduated\"),\n                  ordered = TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Gender\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(Gender = recode(as.character(Gender), '1' = 'Male', '2' = 'Female'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Policy Government Support\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(Policy_Stu = recode(as.character(Policy_Stu), '1' = 'Yes', '2' = 'No'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Minority\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(Minority_Stu = recode(as.character(Minority_Stu), '1' = 'Yes', '2' = 'No'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Poor Household\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(Poor_Stu = recode(as.character(Poor_Stu), '1' = 'Yes', '2' = 'No'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Study Time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvnu <- vnu %>%\n  mutate(\n    Time_Studying = factor(Time_Studying,\n                           levels = 1:5,\n                           labels = c(\"<2 hrs\",\"2–4 hrs\",\"4–6 hrs\",\"6–8 hrs\",\">8 hrs\"),\n                           ordered = TRUE)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe `glimpse()` function is used again to check whether the above variables have been recoded correctly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(vnu)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 2,170\nColumns: 22\n$ Year               <ord> Graduated, Graduated, Graduated, Graduated, Graduat…\n$ Gender             <chr> \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Fema…\n$ Policy_Stu         <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"N…\n$ Minority_Stu       <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No…\n$ Poor_Stu           <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No…\n$ Father_Edu         <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, …\n$ Mother_Edu         <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, …\n$ Father_Occupation  <dbl> 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, …\n$ Mother_Occupation  <dbl> 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, …\n$ Time_Friends       <dbl> 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, …\n$ Time_SocicalMedia  <dbl> 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, …\n$ Time_Studying      <ord> >8 hrs, >8 hrs, >8 hrs, >8 hrs, <2 hrs, 2–4 hrs, >8…\n$ GPA                <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, …\n$ Adapt_Learning_Uni <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, …\n$ Study_Methods      <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, …\n$ SupportOf_Uni      <dbl> 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, …\n$ SupportOf_Lec      <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, …\n$ Facilitie_Uni      <dbl> 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, …\n$ Quality_Lecturer   <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, …\n$ TrainingCurriculum <dbl> 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, …\n$ Competitive_Class  <dbl> 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, …\n$ InfuenceF_Friends  <dbl> 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe also check for missing values again.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(is.na(vnu))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# 4. Univariate Analysis\n\nThe analysis begins with univariate exploration to understand respondent characteristics, followed by bivariate visualisations to examine factors associated with academic performance, and thereby learning outcomes.\n\nTo examine the distribution of the categorical variables, bar charts are created using the **ggplot2** package. Count labels are added with `geom_text()` so that the exact frequencies are visible on each bar, making the chart easier to interpret. As `geom_bar()` automatically calculates the counts, `stat = \"count\"` applies the same calculation to the labels, while `after_stat(count)` retrieves these values for display. The `vjust` argument is used to position the labels slightly above the bars, improving overall readability.\n\n## Respondent Characteristics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\np1 <- ggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = Year)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"aquamarine3\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", \n            aes(label = after_stat(count)), \n            vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_classic()\n\np2 <- ggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"cadetblue3\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\",\n            aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n            vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_classic()\n\np3 <- ggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = Policy_Stu)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"bisque3\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\",\n            aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n            vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_classic()\n\np4 <- ggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = Minority_Stu)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"coral3\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\",\n            aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n            vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_classic()\n\np5 <- ggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = Poor_Stu)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\",\n            aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n            vjust = -0.5) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n(p1 + p2) / plot_spacer() / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n  plot_layout(heights = c(1, 0.08, 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe combined bar charts provide an overview of the respondents’ demographic characteristics. Most participants are alumni, with no first- or second-year students represented, suggesting that the findings largely reflect post-study perspectives and may be subject to recall bias. The sample is notably female-dominated, which could influence the generalisability of the results across genders.\n\nWhile both policy-supported and non-policy students are well represented, minority students and those from poor households form only a small proportion of the sample. This indicates that the dataset is skewed toward students from relatively stable socioeconomic backgrounds, a factor that should be considered when interpreting subsequent analyses of academic performance.\n\n## Academic Performandce (GPA)\n\nGPA is used as the primary variable to evaluate students’ academic performance in this analysis. As the study focuses on understanding the factors that may influence learning outcomes, GPA provides a useful point of reference for comparing other variables. It reflects how well students have grasped and applied their academic knowledge, making it a meaningful indicator of their overall learning outcomes.\n\nAccording to the codebook, the GPA results are coded as follows:\n\n-   Under 2.0 – Poor (1)\n\n-   From 2.0 to lower 2.5 – Average (2)\n\n-   From 2.5 to lower 3.2 – Fair (3)\n\n-   From 3.2 to lower  3.6 – Good (4)\n\n-   Over 3.6 – Excellent (5)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggplot(data = vnu, aes(x = GPA)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\",\n            aes(label = after_stat(count)),\n            hjust = -0.2) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe concentration of students within the Fair and Good GPA bands suggests that academic performance is generally moderate to strong across the sample, with only few students underperforming or having excellent GPAs.\n\n# 5. Key Factors Associated with Academic Performance\n\n## 5.1 Academic Performace Across Study Time\n\nWhen considering academic performance, one of the first factors that comes to mind is how much time students spend studying. The effort devoted to academic work can play a meaningful role in shaping learning outcomes, making it valuable to explore how study time relates to students’ GPA.\n\nA stacked bar chart is created to analyse the distribution of GPA across different study time categories. This visualisation allows for an easy comparison of the proportion of students within each GPA band for every study duration, helping to identify whether higher study time is associated with stronger academic outcomes.\n\nThe `ggplot()` function from the **ggplot2** package is used to initialise the visualisation, while `geom_bar()` is used to create the bar chart. Daily study time is on the x‑axis, and each bar is stacked by GPA category.  `position = \"fill\"`  is used to scale each bar to a total height of 1, so the bar segments represent the proportion of students in each GPA category within a study‑time group. The y‑axis is formatted as a percentage using `scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)` so the proportions are shown from 0% to 100%.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggplot(vnu, \n       aes(\n         x = Time_Studying, \n         fill = factor(GPA,\n                       levels = 1:5,\n                       labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"GPA Distribution Across Study Time\",\n    x = \"Daily Study Time\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Insights\n\n-   Most students fall within the **Fair (GPA 3)** and **Good (GPA 4)** categories across all study durations, suggesting that overall academic performance is generally moderate to strong regardless of the amount of time spent studying.\n\n-   Notably, **no students who study fewer than 4 hours per day achieve an Excellent GPA**, suggesting that a minimum level of study time may be necessary to reach the highest academic outcomes.\n\n-   Students who study **2–4 hours daily** show a slightly higher proportion of **Average** and **Poor** GPAs compared to other groups, indicating that this duration may be less associated with stronger academic outcomes.\n\n-   As study time increases to **6–8 hours** and **more than 8 hours**, there is a modest rise in the proportion of students achieving **Good** and **Excellent** GPAs. This points toward a positive, though not dramatic, relationship between increased study time and improved learning outcomes.\n:::\n\n## 5.2 Academic Performance Across Social Activities\n\nSocial activities form an important part of university life and can influence students’ learning outcomes in different ways. While spending time with friends may support emotional well-being and reduce academic stress, excessive engagement in social media could potentially distract students from their studies. Examining how these activities relate to GPA therefore provides useful insight into whether students are maintaining a healthy balance between their academic responsibilities and social lives.\n\nTo explore these relationships, stacked bar charts are created to visualise the distribution of GPA across varying levels of time spent on social media and with friends.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\np1 <- ggplot(vnu, \n       aes(x = factor(Time_SocicalMedia,\n                      levels = 1:5,\n                      labels = c(\"<1 hr\",\"1–2 hrs\",\"2–3 hrs\",\"3–4 hrs\",\">4 hrs\")),\n           fill = factor(GPA,\n                         levels = 1:5,\n                         labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")\n                         ))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Daily Time Spent on Social Media\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\np2 <- ggplot(vnu, \n       aes(x = factor(Time_Friends,\n                      levels = 1:5,\n                      labels = c(\"<1 hr\",\"1–2 hrs\",\"2–3 hrs\",\"3–4 hrs\",\">4 hrs\")),\n           fill = factor(GPA,\n                         levels = 1:5,\n                         labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Daily Time Spent with Friends\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1 / p2 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Insights\n\n-   Across both social media usage and time spent with friends, the majority of students fall within the Fair and Good GPA categories, suggesting that academic performance remains relatively stable despite moderate levels of social engagement.\n\n-   Students reporting the highest levels of social media usage exhibit a slightly greater proportion of Poor GPAs and a smaller share of Good GPAs compared to those with lower usage, indicating that excessive social media engagement may be associated with weaker academic outcomes.\n\n-   A comparable pattern is observed for time spent with friends, where students spending more than three hours show a modest increase in Poor GPAs alongside a decline in Good GPAs, pointing toward a mild negative relationship between extended social activity and academic performance.\n\n-   Notably, students who spend 3–4 hours with friends represent the largest proportion of Excellent GPAs among all time categories. However, the variation across categories is relatively small, suggesting that the relationship is not strongly pronounced.\n:::\n\n## 5.3 Academic Performance by Parent's Education Level\n\nBar charts are created to examine the relationship between parental education levels and students’ academic performance (GPA). This visualization allows for a clear comparison of GPA distributions across the different education categories for both fathers and mothers, helping to identify whether academic performance varies based on family educational background.\n\nThe `geom_bar()` function from the ggplot2 package is used to display the distribution of GPA within each education category. The parental education variables are relabelled within the plot to improve clarity and ensure that the categories are presented in a logical order. Additionally, the `facet_wrap()` function is applied to arrange the charts into separate panels, allowing the GPA distributions to be compared side by side while maintaining a consistent scale.\n\nSince the number of respondents differs across education groups, proportions are presented instead of raw counts to enable more meaningful comparisons within each category. The `scale_y_continuous()` function is used to display the values as percentages, and the `labs()` function provides clear titles and axis labels to enhance the overall readability of the visualisation.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### GPA with Father's Education Level\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggplot(data=vnu, \n       aes(x= GPA)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(prop), group = 1), fill = \"blue4\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ factor(Father_Edu,\n                        levels = 1:6,\n                        labels = c(\"Primary school\",\n                                 \"Secondary school\",\n                                 \"High School\",\n                                 \"College school\",\n                                 \"University/graduate education\",\n                                 \"Other\"))\n                        ) +\n  labs(y = \"% of Students\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### GPA with Mother's Education Level\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggplot(data=vnu, \n       aes(x= GPA)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(prop), group = 1), fill = \"deeppink3\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ factor(Mother_Edu,\n                        levels = 1:6,\n                        labels = c(\"Primary school\",\n                                 \"Secondary school\",\n                                 \"High School\",\n                                 \"College school\",\n                                 \"University/graduate education\",\n                                 \"Other\"))\n                        ) +\n  labs(y = \"% of Students\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Insights\n\n-   Across both father’s and mother’s education levels, most students fall within the **Fair (GPA 3)** and **Good (GPA 4)** categories, indicating that academic performance is generally moderate to strong regardless of parental educational background.\n\n-   Students whose parents have lower education levels (primary or secondary school) show a slightly higher concentration in the Fair category, while higher parental education corresponds with a modest increase in the proportion of students achieving Good and Excellent GPAs.\n\n-   The GPA distributions across fathers and mothers' education levels are highly comparable, with no substantial differences observed between the two. This suggests that the influence of parental education may operate at the household level rather than being attributable to one parent alone.\n\nOverall, the relatively small variation across educational level of parents indicates that while parental education may contribute to academic outcomes, it is unlikely to be a dominant determinant of student performance.\n:::\n\n## 5.4 Academic Performance Across Institutional Factors\n\nLearning outcomes are influenced not only by students’ individual efforts but also by the academic environment provided by the university. Institutional elements such as facilities, lecturer quality, and curriculum suitability can shape students’ learning experiences and potentially affect their academic performance. Therefore, this section examines how these institutional factors relate to students’ GPA in order to better understand the role of the university in supporting learning outcomes.\n\nStacked bar charts are created to examine the relationship between GPA and selected institutional factors, namely university facilities, lecturer quality, and curriculum suitability. This visualisation enables a clear comparison of GPA distributions within each response category while highlighting how academic performance varies across different levels of institutional support.\n\nThe `ggplot()` function from the **ggplot2** package is used to initialise the visualisations, while `geom_bar(position = \"fill\")` is applied to display the proportion of students within each GPA category. The institutional variables are converted into ordered factors using the `factor()` function so that the response levels — ranging from “Not at all” to “Very” — appear sequentially in the charts. Additionally, `scale_y_continuous()` is used to present the y-axis in percentages, and `labs()` is applied to provide clear titles and axis labels, improving overall readability.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\np1 <- ggplot(vnu,\n       aes(x = factor(Facilitie_Uni,\n                      levels = 1:5,\n                      labels = c(\"Not at all\",\"Little\",\"Moderate\",\"Quite\",\"Very\")),\n           fill = factor(GPA,\n                         levels = 1:5,\n                         labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Responsiveness of University Facilities\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np2 <- ggplot(vnu,\n       aes(x = factor(Quality_Lecturer),\n           fill = factor(GPA,\n                         levels = 1:5,\n                         labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Lecturer Quality\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np3 <- ggplot(vnu,\n       aes(x = factor(TrainingCurriculum,\n                      levels = 1:5,\n                      labels = c(\"Not at all\",\"Little\",\"Moderate\",\"Quite\",\"Very\")),\n           fill = factor(GPA,\n                         levels = 1:5,\n                         labels = c(\"Poor\",\"Average\",\"Fair\",\"Good\",\"Excellent\")))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Curriculum Suitability\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"GPA\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n(p1 / p3) | p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){fig-align='center' width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Insights\n\n-   **Lecturer quality** shows the strongest positive pattern, with higher ratings corresponding to a greater proportion of **Good** and **Excellent** GPAs and fewer lower GPAs. This suggests that teaching quality may be closely linked to learning outcomes.\n\n-   In contrast, **university facilities** show minimal variation in GPA distributions, suggesting a weaker relationship with academic performance.\n\n-   **Curriculum suitability** demonstrates a moderate association with GPA, though the trend is less consistent, implying that while the curriculum supports learning, its influence may not be as strong.\n\n-   Overall, factors directly related to teaching appear to be more strongly associated with learning outcomes than broader institutional resources.\n:::\n\n## 5.5 Adaptation to the Learning Environment and Institutional Support\n\nWhile the earlier analysis examined GPA as a primary measure of learning outcomes, students’ ability to adapt to the learning environment also represents an important dimension of their educational experience. Exploring this variable provides a broader understanding of the factors that support student learning. In particular, analysing its relationship with the support provided by the university and lecturers can offer valuable insight into the institutional conditions that may enhance students’ learning experiences.\n\nTo examine whether students’ ability to adapt to the learning environment is associated with the level of support received from the university and lecturers, a non-parametric correlation analysis is conducted to determine which factor demonstrates a stronger relationship with adaptation. The `ggscatterstats()` function from the **ggstatsplot** package is used to perform and visualise this correlation test.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## University support\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggscatterstats(\n  data = vnu,\n  x = SupportOf_Uni,\n  y = Adapt_Learning_Uni,\n  type = \"nonparametric\",\n  marginal = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lecturer support\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code\"}\nggscatterstats(\n  data = vnu,\n  x = SupportOf_Lec,\n  y = Adapt_Learning_Uni,\n  type = \"nonparametric\",\n  marginal = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](THE01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Insights\n\n-   Both university support and lecturer support show a **moderate positive correlation** with students’ ability to adapt to the learning environment, suggesting that stronger institutional and academic support is associated with better learning adjustment.\n\n-   University support demonstrates a slightly stronger relationship with adaptation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.44) compared to lecturer support (ρ = 0.40), suggesting that while lecturer guidance remains important, institutional support forms a critical foundation for facilitating students’ transition into and engagement with the learning environment.\n\n-   Despite being statistically significant, the correlations are moderate rather than strong, meaning that support alone does not fully explain students’ adaptation. Other factors such as personal motivation, peer networks, and study habits may also influence how well students adjust.\n:::\n\n# 6. Conclusion\n\nThis study examined the factors associated with students’ learning outcomes, using GPA as the primary indicator of academic performance. The analysis explored how respondent characteristics, study habits, social activities, and institutional support relate to students’ academic results. Overall, performance was largely concentrated within the Fair and Good categories, suggesting generally moderate achievement levels across the sample.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n-   Academic performance shows a slight improvement with increased study time, though the relationship is relatively weak.\n\n-   Higher levels of social media use and time spent with friends are associated with a modest rise in lower GPAs, but the differences are not substantial.\n\n-   Parental education demonstrates only minor variation in GPA distributions, indicating a limited influence on learning outcomes.\n\n-    Among institutional factors, lecturer quality exhibits the strongest positive association with GPA, followed by curriculum suitability, while university facilities show minimal impact.\n\n-   The sample is dominated by certain demographic groups, which may affect the broader applicability of the findings.\n\n## Recommendations for Future Research\n\n-    Gather more balanced and representative data to strengthen the reliability of conclusions.\n\n-    Consider additional variables such as student motivation, learning behaviours, mental well-being, and access to academic support for a more holistic analysis.\n\n-   Apply advanced statistical techniques to better understand the strength of these relationships.\n",
