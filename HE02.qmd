# 1. Overview

In this exercise, we will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. The goals of this exercise is to:

-   Control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,

-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages, and

-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.

# 2. Getting Started

:::: panel-tabset
## **Installing and loading libraries**

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.

-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

The code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto our working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel,patchwork,ggthemes,hrbrthemes,tidyverse)
```

::: callout-note
For the newer versions of R, hrbrthemes package would need to be installed by downloading it from git using the code below, as the package has been removed from the CRAN repository.

remotes::install_git("https://codeberg.org/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes.git")
:::

## **Importing Data**

For this exercise, we will be using a data file called Exam_data. It is in csv file format and consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.

The code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package (one of the tidyverse packages).

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/data/Exam_data.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

# 3. Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel

One of the challenges in plotting statistical graphs is annotation, especially when there are a large number of data points.

::: panel-tabset
## The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```
:::

[ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples below.

![](image3.jpg)

We simply replace `geom_text()` by [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()` by [`geom_label_repel`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html).

# 4. Beyond ggplot2 Themes

ggplot2 comes with eight [built-in themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html), they are:

`theme_gray()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_linedraw()`, `theme_minimal()`, and `theme_void()`.

::: panel-tabset
## The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data,
aes(x = MATHS)) +
geom_histogram(bins=20,
boundary = 100,
color="grey25",
fill="grey90") +
theme_gray() +
ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25",
                 fill="grey90") + 
  theme_gray() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```
:::

Refer to this [link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#themes) to learn more about ggplot2 Themes.

## 4.1 Working with ggtheme package

[**ggthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/index.html) provides [‘ggplot2’ themes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, [Fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail), ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.pinterest.com/wsjgraphics/wsj-graphics/), among others.

Below, we're looking at an example where *The Economist* theme is used.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_economist()
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_economist()
```
:::

It also provides some extra geoms and scales for **ggplot2**. Consult [this vignette](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) to learn more.

## 4.2 Working with hrbrthemes package

[**hrbrthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/index.html) package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Math scores") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Math scores") +
  theme_ipsum()
```
:::

The second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used. Consult [this vignette](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/articles/why_hrbrthemes.html) to learn more.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Math scores") +
  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,
              base_size = 15,
              grid = "Y")
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Math scores") +
  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,
              base_size = 15,
              grid = "Y")
```
:::

::: callout-tip
## What can we learn from the code chunk above?

-   `axis_title_size` argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,

-   `base_size` argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and

-   `grid` argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.

# 5. Beyond single graph

It is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions that provide functions to compose figures with multiple graphs. In this section, we will learn how to create composite plots by combining multiple graphs.

First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.

::: panel-tabset
## The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```
:::

Next

::: panel-tabset
## The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of English scores")
```

## The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
p2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of English scores")
```
:::

Lastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Math score as shown below.

::: panel-tabset
## The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Math scores for Primary 3")
```

## The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
p3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x= MATHS, 
                 y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Math scores for Primary 3")
```

## 5.1 Creating composite graphics: patchwork methods

There are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as [`grid.arrange()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html) of **gridExtra** package and [`plot_grid()`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/reference/plot_grid.html) of [**cowplot**](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html) package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.

Patchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:

-   Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.

-   Parenthesis () to create a subplot group.

-   Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign /.

## 5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs

Figure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot is!

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
p1 + p2
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
p1 + p2
```
:::

## 5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs

We can plot more complex composite figures by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted using the following:

-   “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,

-   “\|” operator to place the plots beside each other,

-   “()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
(p1 / p2) | p3
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
(p1 / p2) | p3
```
:::

To learn more about, refer to [Plot Assembly](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html).

## 5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag

In order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown below.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 10
((p1 / p2) | p3) + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
((p1 / p2) | p3) + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')
```
:::

## 5.5 Creating figures with inset

Besides providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout, with [`inset_element()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/inset_element.html) of **patchwork** we can place one or more plots or graphic elements freely on top of or below another plot.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
p3 + inset_element(p2, 
                   left = 0.02, 
                   bottom = 0.7, 
                   right = 0.5, 
                   top = 1)
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
p3 + inset_element(p2, 
                   left = 0.02, 
                   bottom = 0.7, 
                   right = 0.5, 
                   top = 1)
```
:::

## 5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme

Below we are creating a figure by combining **patchwork** and **The Economist theme** of ggthemes package discussed earlier.

::: panel-tabset
### The plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 13
patchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3
patchwork & theme_economist()
```

### The code

```{r fig.show='hide'}
#| results: hide
patchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3
patchwork & theme_economist()
```
